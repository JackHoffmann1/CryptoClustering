# CryptoClustering

## Introduction

The focus of this project is to classify cryptocurrencies based on their price fluctuations across various timeframes using K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This involves preprocessing the data, determining the optimal number of clusters, and visualizing the results.

## Features
- **Data Normalization**: Standardize cryptocurrency price data.
- **K-means Clustering**: Classify cryptocurrencies using K-means.
- **Elbow Method**: Find the optimal number of clusters.
- **PCA**: Reduce data dimensionality.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize clusters with scatter plots.
- **Feature Analysis**: Identify feature influences on principal components.

## How to Use

1. **Run the `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` Notebook**
    
    

2. **Analyze and view the clustering results**
